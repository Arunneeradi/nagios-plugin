Ah! Now I get your question clearly 👌

You’re asking: **“How do I add a new server’s IP address into Kibana so I can monitor it?”**

Here’s the straight answer 👇

---

## 🔥 How Kibana Monitors Servers

Kibana **itself doesn’t directly connect to servers**.
👉 It just **visualizes data stored in Elasticsearch**.

To add a **new server (IP)** for monitoring, you need to:
1️⃣ Install a data shipper (**Filebeat**, **Metricbeat**, etc.) on the new server.
2️⃣ Configure it to send data to your Elasticsearch/Kibana.
3️⃣ Once data flows, Kibana will show the new server in dashboards.

## ✅ Steps to Add a New IP/Server in Kibana

### 1️⃣ On the New Server (192.168.x.x)

Install a Beat (example: Metricbeat for system metrics):

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install metricbeat

# On RHEL/CentOS/Amazon Linux
sudo yum install metricbeat
```

---

### 2️⃣ Configure Metricbeat to Send Data

Edit Metricbeat config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/metricbeat/metricbeat.yml
```

Set your **Elasticsearch/Kibana IP**:

```yaml
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["<kibana-server-ip>:9200"]

setup.kibana:
  host: "<kibana-server-ip>:5601"
```

Save and start Metricbeat:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now metricbeat
```

---

### 3️⃣ Check in Kibana

Go to:

```
Kibana → Observability → Metrics → Hosts
```

You should see the **new server IP (192.168.x.x)** appear there.

---

### 📊 What Gets Monitored?

* CPU, Memory, Disk, Network
* Log files (if you install Filebeat)
* Custom app metrics (if needed)

---

## ✅ Optional: Add to Dashboard

You can now create or edit dashboards to include the new server’s IP.

## ⚡ Quick Recap

| Step             | Action                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Install Beat     | Metricbeat/Filebeat on new IP |
| Configure Output | Point to your Elasticsearch   |
| Start Beat       | Enable and start service      |
| View in Kibana   | Metrics > Hosts Dashboard     |

Do you want me to:
✅ Give you a **ready-made Metricbeat config for your Kibana IP**?
✅ Or a **script to install & configure beats on the new server automatically**?
✅ Or both?
